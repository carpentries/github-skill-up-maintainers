This is a GitHub skill-up for Carpentries Maintainers and lesson developers.
It is designed primarily as a resource for skill-up leaders,
but may also be useful for self-directed learning.

We recommend that skill-up leaders use [the Instructor View](./instructor/index.html) when using the site.

## Target Audience

The skill-up is aimed at people with a basic familiarity with the GitHub interface,
and the process of editing files and 
committing changes to a repository via the GitHub web interface.
It will be particularly relevant to people maintaining/developing
a lesson using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
([the Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/).

## Objectives

After following the skill-up, participants should be ready to practice the following skills:

- Manage issues more effectively with labels, referencing, and automatic closure
- Use GitHub's comment and suggestion features to review pull requests
- Resolve simple merge conflicts using the GitHub web interface
