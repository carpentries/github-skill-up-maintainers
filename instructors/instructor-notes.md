## Using the Example Repository

:::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Setup for Hosts
See [_Setting Up Example Repositories_](./example_repo_setup.md) for instructions
on how to automate the creation of example repos for the skill-up.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The example repository contains source files for a lesson about
how to bake sourdough cinnamon rolls.

The content of the lesson itself is largely inconsequential for the skill-up,
except that it contains several deliberate errors.

The repository has three open issues and three open pull requests,
designed to be used as illustrations of the various concepts taught in the lesson.

## After the Skill-up

At the end of the skill-up, I recommend
transferring ownership of the individual repositories to their respective participants,
and deleting the repositories for any participants who did not show up.
At the moment, you will need to do these things manually
but I hope to add another script to automate this soon.
